# CNN from Scratch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It's a personal learning project created and trained in a Jupyter Notebook environment (originally on Kaggle).

## Features

* Custom CNN model architecture
* Trained on CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes, 32x32 color images)
* Custom entropy loss and SGD optimizer
* Around 75% accuracy on test data

## Notes

This is a personal educational endeavor. The primary purpose is experimentation and learning.
